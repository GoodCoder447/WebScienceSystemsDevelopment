Rather straightforward project, only really needed to use the twitter dev site
and Bootstrap documentation. It was pretty much the music project from last 
semester + bootstrap... Kinda seems not the best learning application for anyone
that previously took the class.

Also the link is broken on LMS so Gina had to send me the Lab1.docx instructions =/
